\section{Future Works}
\label{sec:future_Work}
The proposed future work aims to extend the temporal decomposition framework developed in this research to larger and more complex power distribution systems. The timeline for completion spans three semesters from Fall 2025 through Summer 2026, culminating in dissertation preparation and defense. The work is organized into three main tasks that progressively scale the methodology and conclude the doctoral research.

\subsection{Task 1: Temporal Decomposition for Medium Sized Balanced Three-Phase Systems}
The first task focuses on developing and validating the temporal decomposition approach for medium-scale distribution systems assuming balanced three-phase conditions. So far the mathematical framework for temporal decomposition using tADMM has been established, extending the concepts developed in earlier work to handle time-coupled constraints and multi-period optimization problems. The formulation phase will establish the theoretical foundations and decomposition strategy.

Following the formulation, implementation and testing will be conducted on the IEEE 123-bus single-phase test system. This medium-scale system provides sufficient complexity to validate the decomposition approach while remaining computationally tractable for initial testing. The implementation will focus on developing efficient algorithms and testing convergence properties. This task is scheduled for completion during Fall 2025.

\subsection{Task 2: Temporal Decomposition for Large Sized Unbalanced Three-Phase Systems}
The second task scales the temporal decomposition methodology to large-scale three-phase distribution systems. Building on the insights from Task 1, this phase will formulate the decomposition approach specifically for three-phase unbalanced systems, accounting for the additional complexity of phase coupling and imbalance.

The implementation and testing will be performed on the IEEE 9500-bus three-phase test system, which represents a realistic large-scale distribution network. This task will demonstrate the scalability of the temporal decomposition approach and validate its effectiveness on industry-relevant system sizes. The work is planned for completion during Spring 2026.

\subsection{Task 3: Concluding Research and Dissertation}
The final task encompasses completion of remaining research activities and dissertation preparation. This includes finishing the investigation of differential dynamic programming (DDP) methods, conducting a comprehensive literature review on novel temporal decomposition methods in power systems, and completing any remaining implementations or case studies.

The dissertation preparation and defense phase will synthesize all research contributions, document the methodologies and results, and prepare for the final defense. This task spans from late Spring 2026 through Summer 2026, concluding the doctoral research program.
